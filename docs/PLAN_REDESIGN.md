# PLAN: Job Seeker Dashboard Redesign

The goal of this task is to transform the existing Job Seeker Dashboard from a basic, "very white" interface into a premium, eye-catching, and high-UX portal.

## 🎨 Design Vision
- **Theme**: Premium "Dark/Mixed" mode or high-contrast "Slate & Indigo" palette.
- **Aesthetics**: Glassmorphism, deep shadows, mesh gradients, and smooth micro-interactions.
- **UX Core**: "Actionable Clarity" - the user should immediately see their status and next steps.

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Planning & Analysis (Complete)
- [x] Identify relevant files (`JobSeekerDashboard.jsx`, `variables.css`, `global.css`).
- [x] Analyze current styling (Inline styles, limited CSS variable usage).
- [x] Research premium dashboard patterns.

## 🛠️ Phase 2: Foundation (Styles) (Complete)
- [x] Define a new "Dashboard Theme" in `variables.css`.
- [x] Implement a custom dark technical surface (#0A0F1E).
- [x] Add high-impact "Signal Orange" accent.

## 🖼️ Phase 3: Component Redesign (`JobSeekerDashboard.jsx`) (Complete)
- [x] **Hero Section**: Implemented "Active Pulse" typographic hero with staggered layout.
- [x] **Stats Grid**: High-contrast premium cards with progress trends and custom colors.
- [x] **Pipeline Overview**: Overhauled application cards with interactive hover-reveal effects and technical meta-tags.
- [x] **Portal Navigation**: Synced Navbar with "ASPECT" theme (Dark mode, Forge CV, Vault, Identity).

## 🧪 Phase 4: Verification & Polish (Complete)
- [x] Verified typography scale and responsiveness.
- [x] Finalized "Technical Brutalism" geometry (2px radius).
- [x] Confirmed high-end micro-interactions on all clickable surfaces.
